# CallCheatOnline
CallCheatOnline is a multiplayer browser game based on the card game "Cheat". The website's simple/minimalist interface and lightweight application footprint make this game an ideal target for those who just want to kill some time by playing some casual card games - simply make a new browser tab and start playing!

## Game Rules
The game rules are pretty much the same as the card game it is based off of. The wiki link to the Cheat card game is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_(game)

However, there are some subtle differences, such as there being a possibility for multiple cheat callers and the cheat caller being determined by going in a clockwise direction relative to the current player's turn. This is to reconcile potential advantages for people with good connection to the central server always getting the call in obvious situations.

At the moment, there are no in game tutorials unfortunately - you'll just have to watch my rather cringe-worthy tutorial video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0uLuOSTsBY
